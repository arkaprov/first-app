1. Telephone Communication (5 minutes)

Opening (1 min):
“In today’s fast-paced workplace, the telephone is still one of the most common tools of communication. Unlike emails or texts, it conveys tone, urgency, and clarity in real time. The way we communicate over the phone can make us appear approachable, skilled, and professional—or rushed and unclear.”

Body (3 mins):

Approachability: Speak warmly, use polite greetings like ‘Good morning, this is Arka speaking, how may I help you?’ This sets the right tone.

Skill: Be well-prepared with information. For example, if someone calls about project progress, you should know the exact status instead of fumbling.

Clarity: Avoid long, confusing sentences. Keep messages short, structured, and precise.

Fluency: Maintain a natural pace, neither too fast nor too slow. Silence on the line can feel awkward, so use fillers like ‘Let me check that quickly’ to hold the call.


Example Story (1 min):
“Once, a client called me urgently about a report. Instead of saying ‘It’s in progress,’ I replied: ‘The report will be ready by 3 PM today. Meanwhile, I can send you a summary right now so you have an update.’ This reassured the client, showed my confidence, and strengthened trust.”

Closing (30 sec):
“So, in telephone communication, the key is a mix of warmth, accuracy, and clear delivery. This simple balance makes us approachable, skilled, and effective.”
