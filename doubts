CI-CD workflow using github actions for aws s3

reference link - https://medium.com/@bryant.logan1/ci-cd-workflow-using-github-actions-for-aws-s3-6e15bae5b2d0

1. Jenkins is self-hosted, so more secure. not gh actions; managed by micrososft. 
2. creat s3 bucket - gave name 'arka-github-actions-bucket' -> unblock all public access 
s3bucket -> properties -> static web hosting -> enable -> static -> index.html
Now bucket -> permissions -> bucket policy ->edit -> (give your bucket name here )
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::Bucket-Name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
3. create a GitHub repo : git@github.com:arkaprovolti/static-github-action-web-hosting-s3bucket.git
4. Now that the bucket is properly set up, you can head over to the IAM console to create a user that GitHub will use to upload files to S3.
5. 	Create user and give s3 full access -> create access key
Now to go to secrets and variables of our created GitHub repo -> actions -> new repository secret -> create 3 screts->
Now weâ€™re going to add 3 secrets for the AWS_S3_BUCKET, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

AWS_S3_BUCKET -> bucket name

now go to actions from our repo  -> set up a workflow yourself -> 

name: Upload Website

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@master
      with:
        args: --follow-symlinks --delete --exclude '.git*/*'
      env:
        SOURCE_DIR: ./
        AWS_REGION: us-east-1
        AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
